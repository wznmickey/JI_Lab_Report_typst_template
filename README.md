# JI Physics Lab Report Template in Typst

Created by wznmickey and improved by mQzLjP.

## Usage

The repository contains two `.typ` files: `conf.typ` is a config file that should not be compiled, and `report.typ` is the template to generate the report. To compile `report.typ` successfully, put both in your working directory.

Any issues or suggestions are welcomed.

## Reference

- JI Report Template 2022. rev 4.1.
